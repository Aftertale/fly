# Logical Links

## Incorrect Length
All logical links require at least 2 parameters, the application only received one.  
Github for example requires you to run `set gh-org $orgName` then you can fly via `fly gh $repoName`.

## Logic not found
All logical links must be defined in this repo (under links.tf).
